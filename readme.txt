Version: 1.3

Dynamic Donations
=================

Adds a dynamic charity selection to the checkout for customers with the ability for charity templates. Allow the customer to select how much their donation should be by adding an item to their cart; removes the selection area added with the basic dynamic charities above.

Installation
------------

1. Upload and activate plugin.
2. Go to Group Buying > Addons, check the box for the Dynamic Donations Add-ons.
3. The new add-on has been activated and you can add as many charities as you want in the backend for selection during checkout.
4. Edit the Private Donation Item, add any information you'd like and click update.

Note:
A new deal/project/item is created after activation, saving it in step 4 allows for the necessary donation item to be added to the cart for checkout. This donation holds the dynamic price and the donation selection and by default is private so it's hidden to customers (that are not admins). You could publish this item publicly and add a description thanking them for their donation, however you will need to modify your templates so it doesn't look like a product.
